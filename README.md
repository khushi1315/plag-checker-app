# 🧠 PlagChecker – AI-Assisted Plagiarism Checker Web App
## A Hackathon Project 🌠

PlagChecker is a full-stack web app developed as part of a hackathon challenge, where **80% of the code was required to be AI-generated**. The project is built using **React** for the frontend and **Node.js** for the backend.

While the initial code was generated using AI tools, the main work involved **integrating the frontend and backend**, resolving **real-world bugs**, and managing **API communications**.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Detects plagiarism using backend logic
- 🧩 AI-generated base code with human-led integration
- 🔗 Full-stack structure using React and Node.js
- ⚙️ Handles CORS, JSON requests/responses, and common errors
- 🌐 Designed as a responsive and easy-to-use web app

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Tools Used**: Postman, GitHub, Visual Studio Code

## 📚 What I Learned

- Debugging cross-origin errors and server issues
- Connecting frontend forms to backend APIs
- Working with `app.js` to fix route and logic errors
- Understanding request-response cycles
- Managing asynchronous operations and error handling

## 💡 Notes

- This project was built under hackathon constraints where AI was used for code generation.
- Final integration and all debugging were done manually.
- Project not submitted due to integration error close to the deadline — but solved later.
